assignments_folder.py, entity Class

The AssignmentsFolder class is a simple container class storing a list of child Assignment objects.
It is one level below the parent Course class and inherits from the CanvasEntity base class.

A Course object is the parent object.

See developer_info.txt file for more information on the class hierarchy of entity objects.
